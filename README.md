# Using-Machine-Learning-in-R-to-predict-Major-Depressive-Disorder-among-people-with-OCD
Using tidyverse, caret, and party packages in R develop machine learning algorithms to predict major depressive disorder among individuals with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.

I utilized three different models (random forest, neural network, and Xgboost) to predict major depressive disorder (MDD) among individuals with OCD from the data set I analyzed for one of my publications: Valderrama, J., Hansen, S. K., Pato, C., Phillips, K., Knowles, J., & Pato, M. T. (2020). Greater history of traumatic event exposure and PTSD associated with comorbid body dysmorphic disorder in a large OCD cohort. Psychiatry research, 289, 112962 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9017948/).

The Rmardown file includes code to visualize data and run descriptive statistics for  data inspection prior to creating the models. 

The powerpoint file walks through the process of creating the models.
